# Installation

## Raspberry Pi Installation

Download the newest release (download the RatOS-\*.img.xz file under the assets dropdown) of [RatOS on github](https://github.com/Artemis-CNC/RatOS/releases).
Then use [Balena Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to write that image to the SD card that goes into your raspberry pi (16GB or larger).

Note: this will destroy all data on the card!

### WIFI or Ethernet

When the RatOS image has been written to the SD card, insert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi and turn on the Pi. After a few minutes the raspberry pi will host a hotspot called "RatOS", join this hotspot on your phone or a PC/Laptop with wifi, the password is "raspberry". When connected, open [http://RatOS.local/configure](http://RatOS.local/configure) or [http://192.168.50.1/configure](http://192.168.50.1/configure) and follow the steps presented there to setup wifi and your printers hostname.

Alternatively, if you're using a pi with Ethernet, you can use an ethernet cable instead.

## Preparing your control board

:::info
It is heavily recommended that you flash your board and make sure it is detected in the configurator **before** your start connecting your wiring.
:::

After completing the wifi setup wizard, wait a couple of minutes, then open [http://RatOS.local/configure?step=1](http://RatOS.local/configure?step=1) in your browser (or whatever hostname you chose during setup). Complete the wizard to flash your control board and optionally a toolboard. When you've done that successfully, the configurator will lead you to Mainsail where you can install your printer config and start editing printer.cfg to match your hardware. You can now complete your wiring. Click the links below to see the wiring diagram for your board.

## Updating

After you've configured your printer.cfg and everything is working, go to the `MACHINE` tab in Mainsail. You'll see a sheet with the title "Update Manager", if you're familiar with Fluidd or Mainsail, you'll notice a new entry called `RatOS`. This `RatOS` package will update all the config files in the config folder, improvements, support for hotends, macros, extruders, new boards etc, will be coming to your printer this way in the future. **Be sure to keep this up to date, especially if you update klipper or moonraker**. Always update the RatOS package first, before updating anything else. This is important because Klipper and Moonraker sometimes make changes that require manual system or configuration changes which RatOS will try to do for you.

In case your board fails to flash automatically, you can always go back to the [http://RatOS.local/configure?step=1](http://RatOS.local/configure?step=1) to flash your board if necessary. If you get a klipper error mentioning mcu and hosts versions, this means you need to flash your board.

In general, it's advisable to keep all your packages up to date, but if you're happy with how your printer works and there's nothing interesting for you in the updates, it's perfectly fine to delay updating until a later time. Klipper is a continually evolving project, that also means that bugs _do happen_. In the rare circumstance that bugs are introduced, they're usually fixed very quickly, but if you have a bunch of important prints coming up, maybe delay the updates till afterwards. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, **please go ahead and update RatOS to the latest version**.

## Setup

With the board flashed and everything wired up, you can now proceed to the [configuration guide](configuration).
